    "The rules of Sudoku are simple. A Sudoku board is a grid comprised of nine rows, nine columns, and nine smaller 3x3 sub grids known as _units_. The goal is to complete the grid in such a way that each row, column, and unit contains each of the numbers 1-9 exactly once. There can be no missing or duplicated digits in a given section. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Sudoku puzzle is solved when all the empty cells have been filled with valid numbers, none of which break the \"one of each number per section\" rule. For a given puzzle, there is only one solution, or one combination of answers which don't violate the constraints. \n",

    "## [Terminology](#Terminology)\n",
    "Creating some quick, shared terminology can help to explain the concepts more succinctly:\n",
    "- __Cell__: A certain location on a Sudoku grid.\n",
    "- __Board__: A certain combination of answers and/or empty spaces that make up a given Sudoku grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "## [Modeling Sudoku as a Search Problem](#Modeling-Sudoku-as-a-Search_Problem)\n",
    "Sudoku puzzles can be solved by several different algorithms which approach the task of solving the puzzle differently. One approach is to model Sudoku as a _search problem_. This approach frames the problem in terms of a starting state, a goal state, and a set of interim states that are traversed in order to reach the goal state. When applied to Sudoku, the starting state is the unsolved puzzle, the goal state is the completed puzzle, and the interim state is the set of all partially completed boards that are created as the method approaches the goal state (below, only a single partially solved board is shown). Solving mazes, studying chess, and finding the shortest path between two points can also be modeled as search problems. "

All recursive functions rely on two underlying principles. The first principle is that the function includes some scenario in which the function terminates, referred to as the \"base case\". The second principle is that with each recursion, the function in some way moves closer to its base case. Without these two caveats, a recursive function will continue to call itself forever. Recursion can be broadly separated in to two groups: _structural recursion_ and _generative recursion_. \n",

In this way, the function is structurally guaranteed to terminate, given that each iteration chips away at the remaining data to be operated on. \n"

After all, there is no guarantee that the portion responsible for generating new data does so in a way that approaches the base case. Imagine, for example, that the base case is a list of length zero, and that the generative component doubles the size of the list with each recrusion. The base case would never be reached. For this reason, when creating generative recursion functions it's important to make sure that the data will ultimately meet the criteria of the base case.

Mazes, for example, can be solved using backtracking because the partially completed maze can be represented as a portion of the completed maze.\n",

This means that many boards will be generated with answers that are ultimately proven to be incorrect, but which were plausible when they were added. In the example above for instance, six boards are created, each with a possible answer, but only one of which will ultimately be proven to be _correct_ (remember that Sudoku only allows for one correctly solved board, meaning that each cell has only one possible solution). As a result, branches which are ultimately proven to be fruitless will be pursued until there are no possible valid answers that could be added. These \"dead ends\" are our queue that somewhere up the line a wrong solution was added.\n",

A Sudoku in which all the empty cells have been assigned answers, none of which violate the constraints, is another way of describing the solution. Since our method only adds answers that are valid at the time of their inclusion, if valid answers are able to be added until the board is filled, then the solution has been found. After all, Sudoku only allows for one combination of answers which complete the grid without violating the rules."
